## Self Evaluation Card

Spend a few minutes every day thinking about how you're doing with the weeks
learning objectives:

1. Copy and paste this score card into your `boots/your-name.md` file
2. Indicate where you feel you stand in each of the learning objectives.
   (use an [emoji](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/) for :+1: :gem:!)
3. Add a tweet-sized blurb about what you learned today.

This was a really hard day. It was very satisfying to get a working app up to Heroku, even though it was very small and I don't know if I could replicate the process on my own. I learned a little bit of: RSpec, Capybara, Heroku, Git, MERGE CONFLICTS, and the four rules of Simple design.

# Week 1, Day 3
| Coders Mindset | Testing & TDD | Debugging | Ruby Webapps | ActiveRecord | HTML & CSS |
| -------------- | ------------- | --------- | ------------ | ------------ | ---------- |
|       0.6      |      0.5      |     0.4   |       0.1    |      0.7     |     0.8    |

Today was so much better than yesterday. I'm feeling like I'm getting a more structured look at my learning through this journal and I feel like I have a good sense for Rspec and Capybara today.
