# Week 1 Lightning Talks
Lightning talks are 4~5 minute talks covering a topic or answering a question.
Because you only have 4 minutes, you must prioritize what is the most important
part of a topic.

Everyone will do a lightning talk every week. To volunteer for a talk:

1. Create a branch named "your-name-volunteers-for--talk-x-on-day-y"
2. Move the talk from the [available talks](#availabl-talks) to the appropriate
   day.
3. Put your name in front of the talk title.
4. Submit a pull request!
